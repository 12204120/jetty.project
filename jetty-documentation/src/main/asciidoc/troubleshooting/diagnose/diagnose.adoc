=== Diagnosing Issues In Jetty

How to check the server if you think there is a problem::
* Logging Review
* checking CPU
* checking FDs
* hitting static resources
** Have known health check URIs that you can hit etc.
* making new connections
* creating new sessions
* getting thread dump(s)  -- DONE - see dump-tool.adoc
* getting server dump(s) -- DONE - see dump-tool.adoc

==== Server Logging

If you have not already done so, you should familiarize yourself with link:#configuring-jetty-logging[server logging in Jetty.]
Jetty supports several flavors of server logging, all of which can be used to provide vital insight into how your Jetty instance is running.

==== System Status

In addition to the server logs, it is also important to capture the exact status of the system running Jetty when an error occurs.
What does the CPU load look like?
How much RAM is being used?
Is there an abnormal amount of system read/write?
What are the network statistics?

Having a holistic view of the system is just as critical as a stacktrace or server log file.
