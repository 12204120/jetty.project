=== Reporting Issues In Jetty

General good practices when reporting problems::
* Report version, repeatability, etc.
* Determine and report the time and timezone of the incident
* For all log/debug reports provided, give a description of when they were taken and the state of the server.
* Practice these steps on a good working server and save the results for comparison.
** Have known health check URIs that you can hit etc.
