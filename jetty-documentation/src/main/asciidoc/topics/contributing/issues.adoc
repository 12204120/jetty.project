=== Github: Issues and Features

While not necessarily a support channel for solving a specific user problem, the issue tracker for Eclipse Jetty is a great location for addressing issues or suggesting features you want to see (or ideally contribute) in Jetty.

When you file a Github Issue in the Eclipse Jetty project there are a number of *labels* available and we encourage to you use them appropriately.

* http://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project[Issues at Github].

We have additionally identified and labeled a number of issues that may be appropriate for users of different levels of expertise that might want to contribute to Jetty but not have a specific goal or issue in mind.

* https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22[Help Wanted]
