== Welcome!

Welcome to the Eclipse Jetty Embedded Quickstart Guide.
This guide is set up to introduce new users to using embedded Jetty which is a substantially different experience to using the Jetty Distribution.
First though, a few generally explanations that should help you understand a little more about Jetty, its versions, and its placement in the JakartaEE (formerly JavaEE) ecosystem.
Or just link:#qsge-getting-started[skip ahead] to the good stuff.
