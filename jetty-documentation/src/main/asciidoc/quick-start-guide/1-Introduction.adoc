[[what-is-jetty]]
== What is Jetty?

Jetty is an open-source project providing an HTTP server, HTTP client, and javax.servlet container.

This guide is broken up in to five parts:

* The link:#quick-start[first section] emphasizes beginning to use Jetty.
It provides information about what Jetty is and where you can download it, and where to find Jetty in repositories like Central Maven.
It also provides a Quick Start guide on how to get Jetty up and running as well as an overview of how and what to configure in Jetty.

* The link:#jetty-config-guide[second section] of the guide deals with configuring Jetty at a more granular level.
It explains how to use Jetty to deploy web applications, configure contexts and connects, and how to implement SSL and other security measures.

* Administration of Jetty is the focus of the link:#jetty-admin-guide[third section] of the guide.
From server startup to session management, logging, HTTP/2 support and Jetty optimization, these chapters will help administrators get the most out of their Jetty server instances.
This section also covers configuring many of the most common servlet container features such as JNDI and JMX.

* Aimed at advanced users of Jetty, the link:#jetty-dev-guide[fourth section] of the guide focuses on Jetty development.
A large portion of this section is focused on using Jetty as an embedded server in existing applications.
It contains several examples and how-to guides for making the most out of the Jetty framework.
This section also includes a guide on using the Jetty Maven plugin as well as information on debugging Jetty.

* The link:#jetty-ref-guide[final section] of the guide is a reference section.
Included there are guides on Jetty architecture and Jetty XML syntax, alternate distributions of Jetty and even troubleshooting of common issues.
There is also a chapter on getting involved in the Jetty community including information on how to contribute code and how to find help.

Feedback is always welcome!
Additionally, if you are interested in how to contribute to the open source project there is a link:#community[section on that as well!]

[[what-jetty-version]]
=== What Version Do I Use?

Jetty 9 is the most recent version of Jetty and has a great many improvements over previous versions.
This documentation which focuses on Jetty 9.
While many people continue to use older versions of Jetty, we generally recommend using Jetty 9 as it represents the version of Jetty that we will actively maintain and improve over the next few years.

_____
[IMPORTANT]
It is important that only stable releases are used in production environments.
Versions that have been deprecated or are released as Milestones (M) or Release Candidates (RC) are not suitable for production as they may contain security flaws or incomplete/non-functioning feature sets.

[[jetty-javaee]]
=== Jetty and Java EE Web Profile

Jetty implements aspects of the Java EE specification, primarily the Servlet Specification. 
Recent releases of the Java EE platform have introduced a Web Profile, recognizing that many developers need only a subset of the many technologies under the Java EE umbrella.

While Jetty itself does not ship all of the Web Profile technologies, Jetty architecture is such that you can plug in third party implementations to produce a container customized to your exact needs.

[[jetty-javaee-7]]

In the forthcoming Java EE-7 specification, the Web Profile reflects updates in its component specifications and adds some new ones:

== Finding Jetty in Maven

_____
[IMPORTANT]
It is important that only stable releases are used in production environments.
Versions that have been deprecated or are released as Milestones (M) or Release Candidates (RC) are not suitable for production as they may contain security flaws or incomplete/non-functioning feature sets.

[[qsg-maven-coordinates]]
=== Maven Coordinates

Jetty has existed in Maven Central almost since its inception, though the coordinates have changed over the years.
When Jetty was based at SourceForge and then The Codehaus it was located under the `groupId` of `org.mortbay.jetty`.
With Jetty 7 the project moved to the Eclipse foundation and to a new `groupId` at that time to reflect its new home.

The top level Project Object Model (POM) for the Jetty project is located under the following coordinates.

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-project</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[[qsg-changelogs]]
=== Changelogs in Maven Central

The changes between versions of Jetty are tracked in a file called `VERSIONS.txt`, which is under source control and is generated on release.
Those generated files are also uploaded into Maven Central during the release of the top level POM. 
You can find them as a classifier marked artifact.
