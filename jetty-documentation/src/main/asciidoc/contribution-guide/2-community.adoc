== Participate in the Community

One of the best ways to start contribute and work with Eclipse Jetty is to get plugged into one of the existing communities.
In any one of these you will come across users of neophyte to expert experience and as time permits the developers of Jetty themselves.

include::../topics/contributing/community.adoc[]
include::../topics/contributing/issues.adoc[]

Long story short, if you are interested in getting involved with the community, there are a number of options available and you are encouraged to participate at whatever level you like!
