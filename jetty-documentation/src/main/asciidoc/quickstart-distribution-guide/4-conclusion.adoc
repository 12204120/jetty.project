== Congratulations!

In this Quickstart Guide we've covered the basics of what Jetty is, what version to use, and where to download Jetty.
We also covered getting Jetty up and running for the first time and some of the most common configuration options.
This is only the beginning.
Please see our other guides for fleshing out your Jetty implementation or for information how you can contribute to the Jetty project!
