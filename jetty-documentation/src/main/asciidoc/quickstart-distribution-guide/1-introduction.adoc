[[qsgd-introduction]]

== Welcome!

Welcome to the Eclipse Jetty Distribution Quickstart Guide.
This guide is set up to introduce new users to the Jetty distribution, including downloading and running their first Jetty server.

[[qsgd-what-is-jetty]]
=== What is Jetty?

At the most basic level, Jetty is an Open-Source HTTP web server and Java servlet container.
Development of Jetty began in 1995 with the original foundations laid by Greg Wilkins, who still actively contributes to the project.
Today, Jetty is one of the most widely distributed web servers around.
It has been use to power projects from small websites to massive applications with tens of millions of users.
Companies like Yahoo, Google, Salesforce.com and many more count Jetty as an integral part of their own product offerings.

From the start, Jetty was built to be as flexible as possible while at the same time providing support for the most popular and robust technologies available.
Since it's inception Jetty has been on the forefront of technological innovation and was among the first to offer support for HTTP/1.1, asynchronous servlets, Comet, WebSocket and HTTP/2.

[[qsgd-jetty-documentation]]
=== Jetty Documentation

The Jetty Documentation is broken up in to several guides:

* The link:#qsg-introduction[Quickstart Guide] is designed for users who are new to Jetty.
It provides information about what Jetty is and where you can download it, and where to find Jetty in repositories like Maven Central.
It also provides instructions on how to get Jetty up and running as well as an overview of how and what to configure in Jetty.

* The link:#ag-introduction[Administration Guide] deals with configuring Jetty as a distribution.
From server startup to session management, logging, HTTP/2 support and Jetty optimization, this guide helps administrators get the most out of their Jetty server instances.
It explains how to use Jetty to deploy web applications, configure contexts and connects, and how to implement SSL and other security measures.
This guide also covers configuring many of the most common servlet container features such as JNDI and JMX.

* Aimed at advanced users of Jetty, the link:#dg-introduction[Developer Guide] focuses on implementing Jetty as an embedded technology to complement existing applications.
It contains several examples and how-to guides for making the most out of the Jetty framework.
This guide also includes instructions on using the Jetty Maven plugin and information on debugging Jetty.

* The link:#cg-introduction[Contribution Guide] provides an overview of the resources available to users of Jetty.
It provides on getting involved in the Jetty community, such as mailing lists and GitHub, and includes resources on where to find help.
Additionally, it contains information on how to contribute to the Jetty Project.

[[qsgd-what-jetty-version]]
=== What Version Do I Use?

Jetty 9 is the most recent version of Jetty and has a great many improvements over previous versions.
This documentation focuses on Jetty 9.
While there are many versions of Jetty being used in the wild, we always recommend using the most up-to-date version of Jetty to ensure support for the latest Jetty features, web specifications, and bug fixes.

_____
[IMPORTANT]
It is *crucially* important that only stable releases are used in production environments.
Versions that have been deprecated or are released as Milestones (M) or Release Candidates (RC) are *not* suitable for production as they may contain security flaws or incomplete/non-functioning feature sets.

[[qsgd-jetty-javaee]]
=== Jetty and Java EE Web Profile

Jetty implements aspects of the Java EE specification, primarily the Servlet Specification. 
Recent releases of the Java EE platform have introduced a Web Profile, recognizing that many developers need only a subset of the many technologies under the Java EE umbrella.

While Jetty itself does not ship all of the Web Profile technologies, Jetty architecture is such that you can plug in third party implementations to produce a container customized to your exact needs.

[[qsgd-jetty-javaee-7]]
==== Java EE 7 Web Profile

In the forthcoming Java EE-7 specification, the Web Profile reflects updates in its component specifications and adds some new ones:
